# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1] - Unreleased
### Fixed
- Seed words should be pasted correctly now regardless of which field it is pasted into.
- Seed words should be cleaned correctly now when changing phrase size.
- DApp and token select popups should now allow up/down keyboard input.
- Rules for checking if a token exists were revised to allow only *real* tokens.
  - `totalSupply()`, `balance()`, `name()`, `symbol()` and `decimals()` are *all* checked now.
  - This fixes a bug where smart contracts could have some of those functions but not all, thus being wrongly added as a token.
- Websocket server should now properly close when closing the program, fixing the "zombie process" issue.
- Websocket server should not crash anymore when switching between Accounts.

### Changed
- Buttons are now round to fit better with the UI.
- DApp grid icons are now bigger, looking closer to the token grid ones.
- Transaction links now open in [Snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io) due to the [legacy C-Chain Explorer](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network) being shutdown.

## [2.0.0] - 22/10/2021
### Added
- Support for multiple ARC20 tokens (send, exchange, add/remove liquidity).
- Support for decentralized applications (DApps) in two ways:
  - Metamask-compatible DApps can connect to the Wallet's built-in websocket server.
  - Developers can make native QML DApps for the Wallet and submit them to a separate repo.
- "Developer Mode" (setting for devs to load their DApps locally for testing purposes).
- Slippage configuration in the Exchange screen.
- Component for loading async images (AVMEAsyncImage).
- Support for 24-word seed phrases and QR codes for addresses.
- (Opt-in) Setting for remembering the Wallet's passphrase for a given time when making transactions.
  - Keep in mind the password will be **unprotected** when enabling this setting.
- Contact list for sending transactions.
- Checkbox for auto-loading last opened Wallet at program startup.
- Support for using custom APIs for the Wallet and the Websocket server.
- Support for GIFs and SVGs (for DApp development).
- Right-click menu for enabled and writable inputs (cut/copy/paste, password inputs can only paste).

### Fixed
- Existing accounts no longer have a chance to be rewritten when creating new ones.
- Sending a value of 0 should be no longer possible.
- Support for unicode characters.
- Segfault caused by LevelDB not closing the right way.
- Coin prices lower than three decimals in the market chart should show correctly now.
- Library dependencies when compiling from source are better documented.
- (Most) popups and components should now properly handle focus and keyboard input.
- Overview pie chart now uses up to 16 different colors for better readability.
- Fiat and raw balance values in the Overview screen should be properly truncated now.
- Images are now properly antialiased.
- Amount displays for Staking/Compound were corrected.
- Importing a Ledger account that was already imported should be no longer possible.

### Changed
- UI has a new design (thanks to Natalya Chavez for the work!).
  - Most controls were customized to fit better with the theming.
  - **Pangolin exchange and liquidity screens were removed and converted to a DApp ("Pangolin DEX").**
  - ParaSwap exchange was added in place of Pangolin.
  - Create/Import/Load Wallet and Staking/Compound were properly separated into their own screens to avoid confusion.
- LevelDB is now being used in place of JSON files for ARC20 tokens, transaction history, registered Ledger accounts, DApps and settings.
  - This should make the wallet faster I/O-wise and fix a history duplication bug that happened with JSON files.
  - **The old JSON history file from 1.2.0 and below, if it exists, will be AUTOMATICALLY DELETED when opening the Account in 2.0.0 and above.**
- Code is now separated in a more logical way in the `src` folder.
- OpenSSL was moved to the depends system instead of being a git submodule.
- A new API for network requests is being used, with support for multiple requests (thanks to Markus for the work!).
- The JSON library was changed from [png85/json_spirit](https://github.com/png85/json_spirit) to [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
  - (Most) network requests were also converted to be built using it instead of std::stringstream.
- Price history for assets can now be set to 1 week, 1 month or 3 months.
- Transactions which are likely to fail are now logged to the wallet's `debug.log`.
- API and Graph request loggings were disabled, which should make `debug.log` grow less over time.
- Transactions now have an extra progress step (build, sign, send and **confirm**).
- Transactions can now be optionally retried with a higher fee if they fail.
- Some hardcoded gas limits for certain operations were revised.
- Amount inputs should now permit values starting with a dot (e.g. ".01").
- Private key, Wallet seed and website permission popups were moved from the Settings screen to the Account header.
- Transaction statuses are now checked manually, and the history can be fully wiped with the press of a button.
- Token icons on Staking/Compound screens were changed to avoid confusion.
